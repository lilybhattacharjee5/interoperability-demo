<h2 id="orgf58f91f">Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf58f91f">
<p>
In international politics and political economy, the primitive unit of analysis
is frequenty the <i>state</i>. One of the important observations is how and when
states “align” with each other. Do they support each other when it comes to
conflict with a third party? Do they trade more than one would expect? Since
formal trade agreements (e.g., EEA) and formal alliances (e.g., NATO) only
capture certain aspects of states’ alignment, researchers have looked for other
measures of policy alignment to fill in the gaps.
</p>

<p>
This work introduces a new proxy of policy alignment: website blocking. This
proxy is particularly interesting because it speaks to the information flow in
the digital layer of international politics, a new element to international
trade and cooperation, one which existing proxy metrics fail to capture a
priori. In addition, our proxy measure can be constantly scraped and updated,
offering a higher temporal resolution than existing proxies.

<p>
Big ideas:

<li>Our work suggests a link between Internet governance and other issues in international relations</li>
<li>Since we can capture our metric in real time, we can use changes in our proxy

possible</li>

<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 1: </span>Different proxies of policy alignment create connected graphs of countries. We can compare these proxies across topic areas. Our project adds a new topic area: the Internet.</p>
</div>

<p>
Given two countries, policy alignment refers to the degree to which policies in
those two countries are similar along some set of dimensions. Since a country's
policy stance on any given set of issues is complex and situated to the point of
being unobservable in a measurable way, proxies of policy stances are used.
</p>

<p>
UN voting patterns provide an illustrative example. If two countries vote the
same way in the UN, that's a proxy of policy alignment. UN votes don't carry a
lot of weight in practice, but if we assume that countries cast votes on the
basis of their overall policy positions (i.e., rather than strategically, or
symbolically) then countries that vote similarly are more likely to have similar
policies than countries that vote differently. The core concept here is that
countries do not need to be actively collaborating (e.g., in formal agreements)
to show policy alignment (though they might be). They may be voting the same way
because of some underlying, driving causal factor (e.g., a shared ideology, or
shared geopolitical goals).
</p>

<p>
In practice, the notion of "alignment" is used as a predictive variable for
other phenomena of interest, including but not limited to formal treaties and
alliances. Two countries that have high policy alignment are more likely to
support each other in a conflict with a third party, for example, than two
countries with low policy alignment.

<h3 id="org4e90795">Webpage blocking as a proxy of policy alignment</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org4e90795">
<p>
One critical component of Internet governance is webpage blocking. Website
blocking, typically enacted directly by governments, makes websites unavailable
in a particular country. In different countries, different sets of websites are
unavailable, either by redirecting the website request, or simply dropping the
request or its response. While the technical means for blocking websites are
diverse (discussed below), the end result is that a user cannot access a
webpage.
</p>

<p>
In this project, we use similarities in webpage blocking patterns to achieve a
similar goal. If two countries block the "same" thing (more on that in a
minute), we consider this alignment a proxy of policy alignment. They may not
have conferred, but their blocking decision reveals a shared outlook or set of
geopolitical goals. Compared to existing proxies, ours captures a new domain:
Internet governance. The Internet is a relatively new domain of International
policy competition, as well as a new domain in which trade, cooperation and
conflict all take place. In addition, we can collect data on our metric
continuously, allowing us to detect changes in policy alignment much more
quickly than other metrics can afford.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org2dcd3cf" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org2dcd3cf">Methods</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org2dcd3cf">
<p>
From a technical
standpoint, there are a variety of ways to block webpages. One option is to
manipulate domain name system (DNS) messages in order to make websites appear
unresolveable. Another option is to drop TCP handshake packages with particular
destination IPs, effectively making IP addresses impossible to contact. A
related option is to allow the TCP handshake to occur, but inject follow-up TCP
packets that either break or supersede the legitimate response. Yet another
option is to make a legal case to a particular service provider (for example,
asking Facebook to block a page in a particular country).
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://iclab.org/">ICLab</a>, a longitudinal corpus of website blocking events, seeks to deal with this
diversity in blocking strategies. It focuses on consistency in blocking
measurements across countries and over time. As of this writing, the ICLab has
collected twelve datasets ranging from January, 2017 to September, 2018. In this
paper, we use the ICLab dataset to produce a proxy of policy alignment with
respect to Internet governance. We report on three attempts to use this dataset
to do so. (Note that, before each of these experiments, we cleaned and
pre-processed the data. See Appendix for details.).
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org21cf68d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org21cf68d">Attempt 1: Strict overlap</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org21cf68d">
<p>
The simplest proxy of policy overlap would be to measure exact overlaps in
blocked websites between countries. When two countries block the same thing,
that's a signal of policy alignment in our model. To compute our metric, we
first find the web pages that appear to be blocked in each country, grouping by
the ICLab data’s country column. Because no webpages are known to be blocked in
the US, we consider any sites in the US grouping to be false positives (perhaps
due to websites blocking known VPN endpoints; see Limitations) and filter the
corresponding domain-suffixes out of every country’s blocked list in the cleaned
dataset.
</p>

<p>
This is straightforward in principle, but in practice, yields minimal variation
in the data. During development, we found that there's not much overlap in exact
URLs between countries, generally speaking. Even countries with relatively high
blocking in our dataset have minimal overlap. For most pairs of countries in our
dataset, this method yields no overlaps at all.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org3b508bd" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org3b508bd">Attempt 2: Fuzzy overlap</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3b508bd">
<p>
To get around the lack of strict overlaps in website blocking, we next attempted
to measure fuzzy overlaps in blocking between countries. Consider the webpage
facebook.com/some-page and the webpage facebook.com/different-page. If Country Y
blocks the first and Country Z blocks the second, is that overlap? By the strict
method, no, this would not count as overlap. By this fuzzy method, it would:
they're both interfering with the same root domain, which we will refer to as a
“domain” (rather than ”webpage”). To achieve this, we performed the same steps
as in Experiment 1, but used Python’s tldextract library to separate domains and
suffixes from site urls. We removed any duplicate domain-suffix pairs.
</p>

<p>
However, we still observe very little overlap with this approach. For example,
Turkey and Russia have 121 and 340 blocking events in our dataset, respectively,
but only 23 websites in common.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org8d6eec8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8d6eec8">Attempt 3: Overlap in content of blocked webpages</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8d6eec8">
<p>
Not only do the Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 methods produce minimal variation
in the data, they also lose some important sources of variation: the themes of
the content these two countries are interested in blocking. In some sense, this
seems intuitively closer to the true source of variation we are seeking to
measure. Two states may block different websites that are, in practical terms,
“the same” in that both represent content that state is trying to exclude.
</p>

<p>
Here's an illustrative example. India blocks Facebook pages that advocate for
Muslim rights, especially regarding issues around Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar
(see an <a href="https://wvww.facebook.com/plzsaveallmuslimlnburma">example here</a>). While no other countries block Facebook pages to such a
degree, other countries do block websites at the intersection of religion and
political movements (Turkey, Saudia Arabia, Russia and more).
</p>

<p>
Thus, we set out to measure thematic overlaps in blocked content between
countries. Consider domain1.xyz and domain.abc. If they're both categorized as
"religious," and two countries block them, we would consider this an overlap.
While these categorizations necessarily lack granularity, it is common for
widely-used metrics such as “press freedom” [] or “religious freedom” [] to
categorize content at an analogous level (see Limitations for a further
discussion on classification).
</p>

<p>
ICLab settled on a similar technique, and used FortiGuard's URL categories.
FortiGuard provides a “web filter” for corporations, allowing networks to block
(for example) pornography or gambling sites. To make this service work,
FortiGuard maintains a URL classification service, which returns a category for
any given URL. FortiGuard <a href="https://fortiguard.com/webfilter/categories">maintains 87 different classifications</a>. Their ontology
is tailored toward the instrumental purpose of maintaining corporate web
policies; we return to the implications of this ontology, as well as alternative
ontologies, in our discussion and limitations sections.
</p>

<p>
For each country, we take the FortiGuard classification of each URL. We are left
with a set of classifications, which we can represent proportionally: we can
represent the percentage each category contributes to the total set of a
country’s blocked sites. One advantage of this method is that it is invariant to
the number of blocked sites total, allowing comparisons between countries that
block different numbers of sites.
</p>

<p>
As an example, see a Figure <a href="#org3c9c670">2</a>, in which we see the relative blocking
activity of four countries that are all very differently situated in the
international order.
</p>



<div id="org3c9c670" class="figure">
<p><img src="./img/4country.png" alt="4country.png" />
</p>
<p><span class="figure-number">Figure 2: </span>Categories of websites that are blocked across Turkey, Russia, India and South Korea. We observe that these different countries block websites of various categories in different proportions. There appears to be meaningful variation in the data across countries.</p>
</div>

<p>
This graph strongly indicates that there is meaningful variation in our data
between countries. Motivated by this variation, we devised a similarity metric
by which we can compare any two countries.
</p>

<p>
To compute this similarity metric, we interpret the percentage of websites
blocked in each category as a set of coordinates in n-dimensional space (e.g.,
{10, 20, 30, 40} if there were four categories). We can then compute the
distance between any two coordinates using the spatial cosine distance. We are
left with a distance between 0 and 1, which we can subtract from 1 to represent
closeness (rather than distance) and then interpret as a percentage. By this
metric, the similarity between India and South Korea is 20.4%. Between Turkey
and Russia&#x2014;countries which had only two domains in common in Experiment
2&#x2014;the similarity is 76.46%.

<p>
This proxy reveals a large cluster of countries that are mostly similar to one
another. These are countries with little to no blocking (Israel, Iceland, USA,
Finland); they lie close together.
</p>

<p>
However, the metric also reveals a few surprises. Venezuela stands alone,
blocking a unique mixture of reference content (13.9%), games (10.4%) and
educational pages (11.9%). Saudi Arabia is most similar to South Korea and
Turkey. Sites categorized <i>News and Media</i> account for a similar proportion of
blocked content in Saudi Arabia as they do in South Korea (10.1% and 12.4%,
respectively), as do <i>Advocacy Organizations</i> (0.99% and 1.63%) and <i>Newsgroups
and Messageboard</i> (1.2% and 2.6%). Together, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Turkey
and Russia form a looser cluster.
</p>

<p>
Other countries with blocking are more or less unique. China and India stand
apart from both this loose, four-country cluster and
</p>

<p>
In general, our metric captures significant differences between countries
typically considered to have “closed” internets. China, which is popularly
imagined to export its Internet to its Belt &amp; Road allies <span class="underline">[]</span>, in fact has low
similarity with such countries. It is relatively unique, 90% similar to Hong
Kong. Otherwise, it shares noteable similarities only with Lichtenstein, for
which <i>News and Media</i> sites comprise 19.8% of blocked content (compared to
57.4% in China).

Finally, our findings reveal that the majority of countries in our dataset are
mostly similar; one large cluster dominates Internet policy by our proxy's
measure. A few websites flirt with blocking while retaining a degree of
interoperability with this main block: Vietnam, Serbia, Singapore, Belize,
Taiwan, Bulgaria, Ukraine and Hong Kong all cluster around the peremiter of this
main, interoperable internet. These countries indicate important variations in
our dataset, perhaps signalling a dual risk and opportunity of deviating from
the global Internet on one hand, and enforcing national sovreignty on the other.
</p>

<p>
The value of our findings is, as suggested earlier, dual. First, this work
provides a new and more dynamic metric of alignment that supplements existing
metrics. In this section, we examined our metric in this context. Second, our
metric may <span class="underline">summarize first graf of next section</span>. The following section turns
to this possibility, comparing our metric to existing facets of the
international order and asking to what degree our measurement is distinctive,
and to what degree it overlaps with traditional domains of measurement in
international relations.

How does Internet governance, as measured by our proxy metric, relate to other
domains in international relations? In this section, we correlate our metric to
existing features of the international relations: trade alliances; military
alliances; measures of personal and press freedom; and cultural and historical
ties. We find that our proxy is associated with many of these features,
indicating opportunities for future work to use our metric to deepen insights in
these domains.

<p>
The Internet is often described as both a cause and an effect of trade. As a
cause, the Internet enables trade; countries have an incentive to converge on
Internet governance policies, as doing so will lower trade barriers. As an
effect, high levels of trade between two countries create interdependence
between economies. This interdependence would become more expensive to sustain
if Internet policies between these two countries were highly discrepant; thus,
Internet governance policies converge. While real causal relationships are
likely mixed, both causal pathways give us reason to suspect that trade
relationships might be correlated with shared Internet blocking policies.
</p>

<p>
As a case study, we looked to the European Union. We collected the similarity
metrics between all pairs of EU countries (within-EU group), and between all
pairs of EU- and non-EU countries (outside-EU group). We performed a Mann
Whitney U-Test on the within-EU and outside-EU groups, which found that EU
countries are more similar with one another (M=0.97) than they are with non-EU
countries (M=0.89) group (U=99666, p&lt;0.001).
</p>

<p>
We re-ran this test with EU countries that were and were not members of the
Soviet bloc before the fall of the Soviet Union. “Western bloc” EU countries
were more similar to one another (M=0.98) than to non-Western bloc countries,
whether or not those countries are in the EU (0.93), (U=32701, p&lt;0.001).
However, we do not find evidence that former “Soviet bloc” countries in the EU
were more similar to one another (M=0.97) than to non-Soviet bloc countries
(again, regardless of whether those countries were in the EU) (M=0.93) (U=4327,
p = 0.41).

<h4 id="org1f85060">Takeaways</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1f85060">
<p>
We find that EU countries are overall more similar to one another than they are
to the rest of the world. There are a few possible explanations for this
observation. One explanation is that joining the EU causes "digital behavior" (as
measured by website blocking) to converge. Another explanation is that countries are more
likely to join an alliance when they are more culturally, legally and
politically similar in the first place (see Section <a href="#orgc99b3b1">No description for this link</a> for further
reflections on this point).
</p>

<p>
Surprisingly, however, former Soviet countries within the EU are not
significantly more self-similar to one another than they are to the world at
large. European Union countries that were NATO allies, however, <i>were</i> more
similar to one another than to the world at large. What do we make of this
discrepancy?
</p>

<p>
One explanation is that, while joining an alliance causes countries to converge
on various policies, institutional structures internal to countries set limits
on this convergence. <span class="underline">TODO steve, more ideas here? literature on soviet bloc
etc?</span>
</p>

<p>
Future work could use our proxy as a “leading indicator” of changes in trade
relations, as we can measure Internet blocking continuously. As a country’s
blocking similarity becomes more similar to a given set of countries, we would
expect those countries to be more likely to join a trade pact in the future.
</p>

<p>
Future work could also explore aspects of global trade outside of formal
agreements. Non-tariff barriers to trade [Simon J Evenett] present one potential
avenue. We would expect to find an inverse correlation between non-tariff
barriers and internet proxy: two countries more open to trade should have
similar blocking profiles.

<h3 id="org2094c98">Military alliances</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2094c98">
<p>
Increasing concern about “cyberwar” makes it plain that many see the Internet as
a key tool in military conflict. However, military alliances signal policy
overlap even if no one fires a bullet. Military alliances signal that one
country would be willing to fight for another; alliance signals a willingness to
sacrifice a great deal for another actor, which in turn suggests policy
alignment.
</p>

<p>
Is shared digital policy around website blocking related to shared military
objectives? To evaluate this question, we started with the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO), an intergovernmental military alliance between 30 North
American and European countries. Assuming these countries share military
objectives, we would expect them to have more similar military behaviors. If
digital layer blocking policy is related to military goals, we would expect NATO
countries to be overall more similar by our proxy measure to other NATO members
than to non-NATO members.
</p>

<p>
We collected the similarity metrics between all pairs of NATO countries
(within-NATO group), and between all pairs of NATO- and non-NATO countries
(outside-NATO group). We performed a Mann Whitney U-Test on the two groups, and
found the within-NATO (M=0.97) group had significantly higher similarity scores
than the outside-NATO (M=0.90) group (U=93709, p&lt;0.001).
</p>

<p>
We performed the same test with ASEAN countries (Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia,
Singapore, Philippines, Vietnam, Brunei, Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos). Although
ASEAN countries have a higher overall similarity with one another (M=0.82) than
with non-ASEAN countries (M=0.76), our Mann Whitney U-Test falls short of
significance (U=814, p=0.084).

<h4 id="org5489a58">Takeaways</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5489a58">
<p>
NATO countries are significantly more similar to one another in Internet
blocking patterns than they are to non-NATO countries. It is interesting to note
that we did <b>not</b> find this to be true for former Warsaw pact countries in our
prior analysis (see Section <a href="#orge9ab86f">No description for this link</a>). Together, these results imply that the "digital
consequences" of NATO membership may be greater than those of Warsaw pact
</p>

<p>
Of course, this result does not necessarily indicate that NATO countries have similar
Internet blocking policies <i>because</i> doing so serves their shared military objectives.
Within-NATO scores could be higher due to other legal, historical and trade
relationships between NATO countries. However, our result does provide some
evidence that Internet policy is not entirely detached from military
objectives. 
</p>

<p>
At the same time, and in contrast to NATO countries, ASEAN countries are not
significantly self-similar. <span class="underline">Steve - you said this ASEAN result makes sense&#x2026;

<h3 id="org3b1ceb5">Personal and press freedom</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3b1ceb5">
<p>
Reporters Without Borders’ <a href="https://rsf.org/en/ranking">World Press Freedom Index</a> quantifies the degree of
freedom available to journalists in 180 countries. We find a moderate positive
correlation between blocking similarity and media freedom rank, r(1483) = 0.38,
p&lt;0.001. Countries more similar to one another in press freedom ranking are also
more similar to one another in Internet blocking patterns.
</p>

<p>
Freedom House’s <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world">Freedom in the World Index</a> quantifies the freedom of electoral
processes, political participation, functioning of government, freedom of
expression and association, rule of law, and personal autonomy around the world.
We find a moderate positive correlation between similarity in World Press
Freedom ranking and Internet blocking similarity, r(1483) = 0.45, p&lt;0.001. The
Freedom in the World index and the World Press Freedom indices are themselves
highly positively correlated with one another, r(156) = 0.85, p&lt;0.001.
</p>

<p>
The presence of a positive correlation between blocking similarities implies
that changes to our Internet blocking metric could predict changes to press
freedom and personal freedom in countries. If a country becomes more similar in
its Internet blocking patterns to Sweden, its personal and press freedom
rankings are liable to increase; as it becomes more similar to Russia, we can
infer that its personal and press freedom rankings are decreasing. This
prediction is purely correlative; our data do not present a causal claim in one
direction or the other. That said, our metric promises a faster and
cheaper-to-collect method than existing proxies used in the indices we mention.
</p>

<p>
At the same time, the fact that our proxy does not relate <i>more</i> strongly to
measures of personal and press freedom is itself telling. In other words,
Internet blocking policy cannot be explained entirely by personal and press
freedom alone. Future work should examine where specifically correlations
between Internet blocking and press or personal freedom break down. What about
Internet blocking cannot be explained by press freedom? Those studies could lead
to both a more fine-grained metric of personal and press freedom, and
potentially to a more fine-grained proxy metric of website blocking.

<a id="orgc99b3b1"></a>
</p>

<p>
The correlations we have discussed so far have been suggestive of ties between
Internet governance policy and other domains, such as press freedom, trade and
military alliance. However, in all cases, our findings are confounded somewhat
by shared cultural history. Along with their trade alliance, countries in the EU
share many legal, cultural and historical similarities. The same is true of NATO
members and, to a degree, of countries with high press freedom.
</p>

<p>
To what degree can Internet governance policies be explained by cultural
relationships&#x2014;shared legal precedent and cultural norms? To examine this
question, we analyzed Commonwealth countries, an association of 54 member
states, nearly all former territories of the British Empire. This association
represents a shared history of British colonialism, and correlates with various
cultural factors including use of English language, representative governments
and common law systems. Of course, these member countries are also quite diverse
in GDP per capita and human development. However, if Internet blocking relates
to historical norms around speech, we would expect Commonwealth countries to
have more similar blocking patterns to one another than to non-Commonwealth
countries.
</p>

<p>
We collected the similarity metrics between all pairs of Commonwealth countries
(within-Commonwealth group), and between all pairs of Commonwealth- and
non-Commonwealth countries (outside-Commonwealth group). We performed a Mann
Whitney U-Test on the two groups, and failed to reject that null hypothesis the
within-Commonwealth (M=0.89) group shared higher similarity scores than the
outside-Commonwealth (M=0.89) group (U=9922, p=0.59).

<h4 id="orgb643e82">Takeaways</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb643e82">
<p>
Our finding implies that Commonwealth heritage is not reflected in website
blocking. This throws into question the degree to which our previous
findings&#x2014;significant similarities between EU countries, NATO countries, or
countries with high press or personal freedom&#x2014;are explainable by cultural and
historical relationships alone.
</p>

<p>
However, historical relationships are not the only proxy of shared cultural
connection. Present-day cultural connections may be better measured through, for
example, plane flights. We might expect countries with high Internet blocking
similarities to have more airline flights between them. Future work could
explore these and other relationships to determine how cultural, political and
legal similarities may explain variance in Internet blocking patterns.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgab1d84e">
<p>
We had 12 datasets (csv files) ranging from January 2017 to September 2018 which
amounted to a total of 50,436,865 observations. Each observation represents a
single GET request to a particular URL in a particular country at a particular
time. These observations represent both blocked and not-blocked websites; they
represent queries meant to discover if a website is blocked or not. Results are
reported regardless of the test outcome. Since this data is from longitudinal
study, our data set may contain multiple GET requests to the same website across
different countries at different points of time.
</p>

<p>
We consider a website blocked when a website has any of ICLab’s blocking-related
features set to True (dns<sub>all</sub>, censored<sub>updated</sub>, block, packet<sub>updated</sub>). This
permissive approach allows us to detect all types of blockings available to
ICLab. We count each such dataset as blocked. Over all observations in the
datastet, 232,348 are blocked, or 0.46% of the dataset.
</p>

<p>
Finally, we augment this dataset by adding the Fortiguard category for each
website observed to be blocked in the dataset. After this process, we are left
with 78 categories of website blocking across 55 countries.

<p>
While ICLab does a good job at detecting when a website is blocked, there are a
few limitations that hinder our ability to reliably decide if a given webpage is
blocked or not.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Particular websites may discriminate against VPN users. For example, Netflix
blocks all known VPNs. This may make a website appear to be blocked when it
really isn't. For now, we correct for this by tossing out all websites that
appear to be blocked in the US, as we know the US does not block any websites
(at least not in the traditional sense ).</li>
<li>Some VPN providers manipulate traffic themselves (sometimes injecting ads).</li>
<li>Lists of URLs to test are biased. What websites do you test for censorship?
ICLab cobbles together numerous datasets from across the web, but some
(especially the Citizen Lab lists) suffer from selection bias, as they're
manually curated by activists with a particular political bent.</li>
<li>Vantage points can be difficult to set up in countries where censorship is
rampant, and in countries with adversarial regimes. These points are
typically set up by volunteers. For example, Iran and Syria have no
volunteers for now, as the ICLab maintainers decided the political situation
is too risky there. ICLab lost access to VPNs in Iran in May 2017 due to
sanctions, resulting in missing data in that country. Missing data in that
country makes there appear to be little censorship, when in fact censorship
may be much higher than we are measuring.</li>
<li>Countries could evade censorship detection. If a country can conceal its
censorship actions, how would we know they're doing it? This is a major
source of epistemic risk: countries may be using secret or unknown mechanisms
to achieve blocking in certain countries, or may be strategically avoiding
censoring content to vantage points such as VPNs.</li>
<li>TCP handshakes create some uncertainty as we’re not sure whether the
observations constitute actual interference. More data from more vantage
points could resolve some of this ambiguity.</li>
</ol>

<p>
A more fundamental issue with ICLab data is that the blocking events in this
dataset do not necessarily relate to government action. Individual websites,
such as Netflix, can choose to block traffic originating from particular
countries. We decided to include these cases of probable non-government
blocking, as they still show a degree of Internet fragmentation&#x2014;the degree to
which the Internet is different across different countries.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org1df8c17" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org1df8c17">Content categorization</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1df8c17">
<p>
FortiGuard doesn't capture the fine-grained thematic content of a website.
FortiGuard <a href="https://fortiguard.com/webfilter?q=https://www.facebook.com/BlackLivesMatter/&amp;version=8">classifies the Facebook BlackLivesMatter group as "social
networking"</a>, indicating that FortiGuard does not capture the subject matter of
particular Facebook pages. FortiGuard’s 87 categories are based on the user
needs of their “three major groups of customers: enterprises, schools and
homes/families.”<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> It is unclear that these categories are a perfect fit for
our usecase of measuring or detecting policies behind website blocking
decisions.
</p>

<p>
However, a pervasive epistemological issue is that we don’t know what the right
categories should be. The “ground truth” category for Black Lives Matter’s
Facebook page, for example, is unclear. Is it “race”? “Politics”? These
boundaries are even less clear for religious movements in Myanmar. Some
categories straddle the religious and political, while FortiGuard’s given
categories (e.g., “extremism,” “drug abuse”) embed their own politics. Future
work could make alternative or complementary categories for webpages based on
NLP, allowing us to uncover or induce multiple overlapping topics from webpages
in our corpus rather than relying on the overly-simplistic, one-of-n
classification of webpages.
</p>

<p>
Also, we can't be sure that governments (versus private companies) are really
performing the censorship we're detecting. It could very well be the case that
renegade ISPs censor things, or that individual sites refuse to serve particular
countries (perhaps to cut down on fraud or avoid sanctions). While it's
overwhelming likely that censorship is occurring with state support, the
difficulty in knowing for sure adds some uncertainty to our use of these data as
a proxy for policy.

<h4 id="org01320fc">False negatives</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org01320fc">
<p>
One epistemic issue in our dataset is possible false negatives. As an example of
when this issue might crop up, consider China and India. China and india both
have roughly the same number of observations (2597 vs 2921), but India has a
much higher number of websites blocked (519 vs 47). There are a few possible
explanations for this observation. One is that India blocks more frequently than
China. However, other possible explanations point to issues of false negatives.
Websites censored in China may not appear on the lists used by ICLab.
Alternatively, this difference in the number of blocked websites may be an
artifact of the nature of blocking in China, which could focus more on content
within apps then with specific URLs.
